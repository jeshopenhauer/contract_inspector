Article 2: Exclusions

The obligations of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not apply to Confidential
Information that:

a) was, as of the Effective Date, or has subsequently become, publicly known through no
wrongful act of the Receiving Party;

b) has been disclosed by a third party (other than a duly authorized third party under
Article 3 hereof) without restriction, unless the Receiving Party knew or ought to have known
under the circumstances, that the information had been obtained directly or indirectly from the
Disclosing Party and that the disclosure of the information was made unlawfully;

c) that was already in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to the date of disclosure
and is not subject to an obligation of confidentiality;

d) which is disclosed by a Party to its Affiliate(s) so long as the Affiliates respect the
same confidentiality obligations as those contained herein. The Party so disclosing the
Confidential Information to its Affiliate(s) shall remain liable for the actions or omissions of
its Affiliate(s);

e) the disclosure of which is authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing in advance of
the disclosure.

A Party which relies on one of the foregoing exclusions carries the burden of proving it.
