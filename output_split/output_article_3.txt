Article 3: Preservation and Restricted Use of Confidential Information

All Confidential Information:

a)
shall be safely and securely kept and stored by the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party 
shall protect the Confidential Information with the same degree of care as the Receiving Party 
uses with its own Confidential Information (but in no event with less than reasonable care) in 
order   to   prevent   the   express,   inadvertent   or   accidental   disclosure   of   the   Confidential 
Information and shall limit the reproduction and disclosure of such Confidential Information to 
its employees or directors to a strict need-to-know basis.

b)
shall only be disclosed  to the Receiving Party’s employees on a strict need-to-know 
basis. The Receiving Party shall ensure that such employees are bound by confidentiality 
undertakings at least as restrictive as those contained in this Agreement. The Receiving Party  
shall remain responsible for compliance with this Agreement by its Affiliates.

c)
shall not be disclosed to third parties without the express written prior authorization of 
the Disclosing Party. In the exceptional case when the Disclosing Party does authorize such 
disclosure,   the   Receiving   Party   wishing   to   so   disclose   to   the   third   party   shall   execute   a 
confidentiality agreement with the same or substantially the same terms as those provided in 
this Agreement and that Receiving Party shall remain liable for any disclosure by the third party. 
If the Confidential Information is requested by a public authority as required by an applicable 
law or regulation (to the extent permitted by such laws or regulations), the Receiving Party shall 
give prompt Notice of such request to the Disclosing Party (including by e-mail, the receipt of 
which is acknowledged) in order to permit the Disclosing Party to seek an appropriate limitation 
or remedy prior to such disclosure.

d)

shall only be used by the Receiving Party in direct relation with the Purpose.

If software or samples or prototypes are provided hereunder, the Receiving Party shall not 
reserve   engineer,   including   but   not   limited   to   disassembling   and   decompiling,   any   such 
software or samples or prototypes.
