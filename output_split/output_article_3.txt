Article 3: Preservation and Restricted Use of Confidential Information

All Confidential Information:

a) shall be safely and securely kept and stored by the Receiving Party. The Receiving
Party shall protect the Confidential Information with the same degree of care as the Receiving
Party uses with its own Confidential Information (but in no event with less than reasonable
care) in order to prevent the express, inadvertent or accidental disclosure of the Confidential
Information and shall limit the reproduction and disclosure of such Confidential Information
to its employees or directors to a strict need-to-know basis.

b) shall not be disclosed to third Parties without the express written prior authorization of
the Disclosing Party. If the Confidential Information is requested by a public authority as
required by an applicable law or regulation (to the extent permitted by such laws or
regulations), the Receiving Party shall give prompt Notice of such request to the Disclosing
Party (including by e-mail, the receipt of which is acknowledged) in order to permit the
Disclosing Party to seek an appropriate limitation or remedy prior to such disclosure.

c) shall only be used by the Receiving Party in direct relation with the Purpose.
