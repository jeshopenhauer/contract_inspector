Article 5: Ownership of the Confidential Information/No license

5.1 Any and all rights, title and interest in the Confidential Information of a Party shall
remain its exclusive property. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring or
granting to the Receiving Party any intellectual or industrial property right, license, or right to
use whatsoever the Confidential Information, either express or implied, other than for the use
provided hereunder in relation to the Purpose.

5.2 Although the purpose of the present Agreement is only to examine and investigate, on

exceptional event that such examination and investigation leads to the creation of particular
results, whether or not they are protected through an intellectual property right, the
Supplement will define the attribution of ownership and exploitation rights to such results.
