Article 13: Urgent measures


Any violation or threatened violation of any terms of this Agreement can cause immediate and irreparable harm to a Party. Therefore, and notwithstanding any provisions herein and without prejudice to any rights and remedies otherwise available, a Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief by way of injunction or other urgent proceeding in the event that the other Party breaches or threatens to breach any of the provisions of this Agreement before any competent court.


If an arbitration clause is applicable, such urgent measures may be initiated at any time including prior to the commencement of arbitration and may be carried out outside of the ambit of the arbitral institution. The Parties hereby expressly opt out of any such urgent measure rules of a given arbitral institution.
